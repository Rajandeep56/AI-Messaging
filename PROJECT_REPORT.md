## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Navigation Issues
**Problem**: Complex navigation flow between authentication and main app
**Solution**: Used Expo Router with proper navigation guards and state management

### 2. Data Persistence
**Problem**: Need for persistent chat data
**Solution**: Implemented JSON file storage with ChatManager utility

### 3. State Management
**Problem**: Complex state updates across multiple screens
**Solution**: Used React hooks with proper dependency arrays and cleanup

### 4. UI/UX Consistency
**Problem**: Maintaining WhatsApp-like design
**Solution**: Created consistent color scheme and component library

### 5. Type Safety
**Problem**: TypeScript errors and type mismatches
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive interfaces and proper typing

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Screens load only when needed
2. **Memoization**: Used React.memo for expensive components
3. **Efficient Lists**: FlatList with proper keyExtractor
4. **Image Optimization**: Used optimized avatar URLs
5. **State Updates**: Minimal re-renders with proper state management

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- Manual testing on iOS simulator
- Cross-screen navigation testing
- Data persistence verification
- UI responsiveness testing
- Error handling validation

## Deployment & Distribution

- Expo development build
- Local development environment
- Ready for app store deployment
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Planning**: Proper architecture planning saves significant refactoring time
2. **State Management**: Centralized state management is crucial for complex apps
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling improves user experience
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents many runtime errors
5. **User Experience**: Attention to detail in UI/UX is essential for chat apps

## Code Quality Metrics
